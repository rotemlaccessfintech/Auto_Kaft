# Project Overview and Electron Refactoring Goal

This project is currently a web application built with React for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend.

## Current Key Files:
- **Frontend:** Managed via `npm start` (using `react-scripts`). The main UI component is likely in `[src/App.js](mdc:src/App.js)`.
- **Backend:** A simple Express server in `[server.js](mdc:server.js)` handles API requests (specifically `/execute-command`).
- **Configuration:** `[package.json](mdc:package.json)` defines dependencies and scripts.

## Refactoring Goal:
Convert this web application into an Electron desktop application.

- **Electron Main Process:** A new main process file (e.g., `electron/main.js`) will be created to manage the application lifecycle and host backend logic.
- **Backend Logic Migration:** The command execution logic from `[server.js](mdc:server.js)` will be moved into the Electron main process.
- **Frontend Integration:** The React application will run as the renderer process within Electron.
- **Communication:** Inter-Process Communication (IPC) will be used for the frontend (renderer) to communicate with the backend logic (main process).
- **UI:** The UI will be updated to function as a desktop widget, potentially with system tray integration and status indicators.
